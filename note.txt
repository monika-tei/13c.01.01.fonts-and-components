Alrighties, so for Monday, let's get these below done:

- Focus on Fonts; ++
- Pick 2 Fonts++
- Create a font hierarchy, use Type Scale (REM) ++
- Line height ++ish
- Margins ++
- padding ++

**You are finished when you think the texts look good or when you have applied font-size, line-height, margin and padding rules to all text elements.
